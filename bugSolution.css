The solution is to explicitly set the `background-size` property to control how the background image is scaled within the element.

Here are a few options:

* **`background-size: cover;`**: This scales the image to cover the entire element, maintaining its aspect ratio but potentially cropping parts of the image. This is ideal when you want to fill the element completely.
* **`background-size: contain;`**: This scales the image to fit within the element without cropping, maintaining the image's aspect ratio. This is useful when you want to preserve the entire image.
* **Specify dimensions:** You can also provide explicit width and height values for the background image.

Here's the corrected CSS from `bugSolution.css`:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
}
```

By using `background-size: cover;`, the image will always fill the div element, ensuring there are no gaps.
