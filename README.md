# CSS Background Image Gap Issue

This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue where a background image doesn't fully cover the element, leaving visible gaps.  The problem stems from the default `background-size` behavior. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a fix.

**Problem:**

The background image in `bug.css` doesn't scale correctly to fit the element's dimensions due to the default `background-size: auto` behavior.  This frequently happens when the aspect ratio of the image doesn't match the element's aspect ratio.

**Solution:**

`bugSolution.css` demonstrates how to fix the issue by explicitly setting the `background-size` property to `cover` or `contain` (or providing specific width and height values) to ensure the background image properly covers the element.
